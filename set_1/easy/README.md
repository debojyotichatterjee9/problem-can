#### Given a sorted array of positive integers, rearrange the array alternately i.e first element should be a maximum value, at second position minimum value, at third position second max, at fourth position second min, and so on. Rearrange an array in maximum minimum form using Two Pointer Technique.

```
Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} 
Output: arr[] = {7, 1, 6, 2, 5, 3, 4}

Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} 
Output: arr[] = {6, 1, 5, 2, 4, 3} 
```
