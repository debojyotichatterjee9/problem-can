### 1. RUNNING_SUM_OF_1D_ARRAY
Given an array `nums`. We define a running sum of an array as `runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i])`.

Return the running sum of `nums`.

Example:
```javascript
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,3,6,10]
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4].
```
Constraints:

* 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
* -10^6 <= nums[i] <= 10^6
